			<description>Do Repeat Yourself One of the first software development principles programmers learn is the DRY principle: Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself. One can think of it as being quite self-explanatory, without requiring to go beyond &amp;ldquo;remove duplication&amp;rdquo; to claim understanding of it. Is that enough, though?

			<description>About me Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of this vast world wide web. My name is Guilherme Johansson Tramontina. I develop software for a living. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a software developer at InDebted, in the beautiful Sydney, Australia.
Social Media I&amp;rsquo;m not an avid user of social media. In fact, I try to avoid it as much as I can. There are, though, a few that I end up using more than I&amp;rsquo;d like to admit.</description>
