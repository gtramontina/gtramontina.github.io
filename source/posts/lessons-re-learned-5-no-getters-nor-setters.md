# No Getters nor Setters

_Note: This post is part of the series [Lessons (re)learned](/posts/lessons-re-learned-0)._

A lot has been said about the perils of using _getters_ and _setters_—also known as _accessors_ and _mutators_—in object oriented software. To cite a couple: [Allen Holub](https://holub.com/), back in 2003, published "[Why getter and setter methods are evil](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2073723/why-getter-and-setter-methods-are-evil.html)"; [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com/), a decate later, wrote "[Getters/Setters. Evil. Period.](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html)".
