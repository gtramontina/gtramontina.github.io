# About me

Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of this vast world wide web.

My name is <span lang="pt-BR">Guilherme Johansson Tramontina</span>. I develop software for a living. I'm currently working as a software developer at [InDebted](https://indebted.co), in the beautiful [Sydney, Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney).

## Social Media

I'm not an avid user of social media. In fact, I try to avoid it as much as I can. There are, though, a few that I end up using more than I'd like to admit. Here's how you can find me (in rough order of activity):

- [GitHub](https://github.com/gtramontina)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@gtramontina)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/gtramontina)
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3130625/gtramontina)
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@gtramontina)

# This website

The ideas and opinions expressed here are my own. In fact, they are the result of an amalgamation of things. Studying, reading, listening to podcasts, attending conferences and meetups, hallway conversations, life. So Iâ€™m thankful to those who I crossed paths with for helping shape my ideas and opinions. Thank you! That said, it doesn't mean they can't change. Let's chat!
